# Print the value in python language
print("this is the first line of code of python language,that is running in the github repositrory.")

# Declaring the variable in python language
my_name="Usman Shahid" # syntex for variable declaration is like( variable_name=value), variable has different data type. This variable, "my_name" is assigned a string datatype value.
my_age=22 # this variable is assigned an "int datatype " value .
my_height=5.8 # this variable is assigned "float datatype" value.
# print the value of the variable with variable. We use "print()" for print the value in python language.
print("My name is ",my_name,". and my age is ",my_age,", and my height is ",my_height)


# Rules for declaring variables
# 1. Start variable name with letter or underscore"_"
# Example 
my_var="this is variable name started with letter"
_myvar="This is variable name started with letter"

#2. We can include number, letter, underscore while declaring variable name. Note: variable name can't be started with any number.This rule is illustrated below
right_var="Variable started with letter"# Write declaration. Note: We can use upper and lower case letter to declare variable. But using lower case is good practise.
_rightvar="Variable started with underscore"# Write declaration using underscore. Note: We can use underscore in middle of letters or variable  name.
'''
2_var=" Variable started with number."# this is wrong way to declare variable.'''. # I used triple qutation for commenting this line of code as this line when cause an error during execution.
# We can use number in variable declaration after first charecter or first underscore.
right_2_var="this is the way to use it."# as 2 is number we can use any number in variable declaration.



# Rule no 3: Avoid using reserved word while variable declaration.
'''
if= 3'''# This is wrong as "if " is the reserved word.

# Variable names in python are case sensitive. For instance if you names first variable name as" My_Value" and other as "my_value". Both of these are completly different because of case sentivity of python.


#While python allowes single charector variable name. But it will be good practise to use descriptive name , so that you can easily remember variable name in future.
# First example
a=" Usman Shahid"
b= 22
c=5.8

# Second Example
name=" Usman Shahid"
age=22
height=5.8

# As we notice seconde example is easy to remember in future as compare to first one.


# use consistance naming convention such as " snake_case" or " camalCase"
my_value_name=" variable"
myValueName= "Variable"
