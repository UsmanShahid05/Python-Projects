# In python there are two types of comments 
# Type one: Single_line_comment: This comment is used for just single line

# This is single line comment.
# We can use comment beside any code also , like following
var_with_comment="Hello World" # This line will execute but we can place comment near to line for description of the code for future and better understanding.

# Type two: Multiple_line_Comment: This comment is used for multiple line which we don't want to be executed while executing whole code.
# Syntex of multiple_line_Comment is by using triple qutation i.e ''', at start and ''' at end
